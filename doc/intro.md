[OpenAPI](https://openapis.org/) provides a standardized, language-agnostic way
of specifying an HTTP API in either JSON or YAML. This specification provides
all the information necessary—such as endpoints, request parameters and types,
and response codes—to call the API. And it provides everything necessary for
the host language to present the HTTP API in a natively idiomatic way to the
programmer. It is this role that _Nectary_ plays.
